## Summary

I am a creative software architect and engineering leader with fifteen years
experience in all aspects of software design and delivery - from product
definition and development, to usability and user interface design to full-stack
application development and front-end architecture. I have delivered large scale
projects used by millions of users for tier one telcos and broadcasters around
the world on [most major platforms and devices](#user-content-platforms),
working with a wide range of
[technologies and solutions](#user-content-technologies). I have also initiated
and contributed to a number of [open source projects](#user-content-community)
as well as regularly speaking at, and
[organising community events](#user-content-community).

I care deeply about the culture and processes required to build effective teams
and maximise their potential. I genuinely love building polished products that
delight users and empower businesses.

Creating software is an intoxicating mix of analytical and creative thinking:
taming human complexity with logic and order; delivering predictability and
stability from changing and imperfect requirements. I am truly fortunate to have
found a career that challenges and inspires me.

## Strengths

### Engineering Leadership

My extensive experience on both product and service delivery teams has given me
valuable insight into opportunities for improving company wide engineering
processes, from sales through to delivery:

- Research and development
- Sales engineering and estimation
- Process implementation and refinement

### Team Development

At Deltatre I was involved in building the UI Engineering teams in both Sydney
and London offices. Building effective teams involved careful attention to
hiring, induction and performance evaluation to best understand the strengths
and weaknesses of new employees:

- Recruitment and team building
- Induction and mentoring
- Performance review

### Developer Productivity

The right processes and tools can dramatically improve the ability of a team to
define, design and deliver quality software in a predictable way. In every role
I have championed the iterative refinement of the development process:

- Agile tools (Confluence, JIRA, Stash, Bamboo)
- Build tools (Rake, Ant, Gradle, NPM+Gulp, custom)
- Continuous integration and release

### Quality Assurance

Effective QA requires close collaboration between engineers and testers,
designing features with testability in mind, and a tight QA feedback loop. At
Deltatre I was involved in the development and deployment of automated testing
tools (unit, mocking and code coverage) as well as the definition of company QA
processes:

- Code review (style and architecture)
- Unit and integration testing
- Build and test automation

### Video Delivery

Deltatre builds TV Everywhere solutions. Leading the client SDK team gave me
valuable insight in delivering live and on demand video content to a huge range
of devices:

- Encoding, packaging and encryption
- Playback, analytics and QoS
- VOD / live workflows

## Experience

### Director, Solutions Engineering (4 years)

At [Deltatre](https://www.deltatre.com) I lead a cross-disciplinary team that
spans commercial, technical, user experience and legal concerns. We are
responsible for the technical architecture, design vision and commercial
modeling of all new business for the Video Experiences Division, pitching
multi-year projects to tier-one telcos and operators in the 5-40M USD TCO range.

Key acheivements:

- Sales growth of 50% year-over-year to over 150M USD PA
- Lead a complete rethinking of our commercial modeling process, using a data
  driven approach that provided customers with transparency and encouraged
  continual improvement within the team
- Engaged with all parts of the business to better model costs spanning product
  licensing, cloud hosting, B2B / B2C support, professional services and more.

### Solutions Architect (2 years)

At [Massive Interactive](https://www.massive.co) I led service delivery teams in
the London and Prague offices in delivering projects built on the AXIS Video
Platform. My oversight spanned the duration of each project ‚Äì from sales and
estimation, to delivery and eventual handover to ongoing support teams. During
the sales process I was responsible for communicating Massive's platform and
solutions to potential clients, refining the sales pitch based on the
requirements and scope of the project.

Projects included:

- [CraveTV](https://www.cravetv.ca) (Bell Media)
- [My5](https://my5.tv) (Channel 5)
- [YouView](https://youview.com) (YouView)
- [Videoload](https://www.videoload.de) (Deutsche Telekom)
- [Animax](https://www.animaxtv.com) (Sony Pictures Entertainment)

### Software Architect (4 years)

At [Massive Interactive](https://www.massive.co) I designed and delivered the
[Massivision MDK](http://www.massive.co/products), a cross-platform UI toolkit
targeting Flash, HTML/JavaScript and C++/OpenGL written in
[Haxe](https://haxe.org). The development of the MDK was completed in 18 months
by a team of five developers, and consisted of a large number of modular
libraries:

- Low level graphics abstractions for HTML/CSS, Flash and OpenGL
- Flexible high level component library including widgets, layout and focus
  management, multiple input methods (touch, mouse, remote control unit, voice)
- Cross-platform unit testing, code coverage and mocking support
- Robust dependency injection based MVC framework
- Custom build tool for compiling and packaging applications for each platform
- Pluggable API support for Android, iOS and a wide range of connected TVs and
  consoles
- Custom package manager for installing project dependencies
- VAST/VMAP/SMIL capable video player supporting a range of streaming and DRM
  options
- Support libraries and utilities

The MDK has been used on projects by tier one telcos and broadcasters around the
world, including: Univision, Telstra, Viocorp, Cisco, Northern and Shell, Bell
Media, Rogers, Dendy, TabCorp Australia and British Telecom. The multi-platform
nature of the MDK allowed Massive to deliver these projects faster and more
efficiently than our competition.

As architect of the MDK I also took responsibility for developing and
documenting appropriate quality control processes for both the product and
service teams using the MDK.

- Unit, integration and behavioural testing
- Continuous integration (first on Team City, then on Bamboo)
- Release and dependency management
- Documentation (high level and API)
- Source management (branching work flow and code-review)
- Architecture and code style guidelines

### Software Engineer (1 year)

At [Massive Interactive](https://www.massive.co) I developed complex data-driven
Flex applications including a video recruitment tool and a collaborative data
entry tool for the United Nations
[Trade for Sustainable Development](https://www.standardsmap.org) organisation
with more than four thousand entry fields. I also led the team building a video
on demand store for a resource constrained set top box (BT Vision on YouView).
The project involved working with prototype hardware and pushing very limited
resources as far as possible. The store interacted with a variety of back-end
services for content, authentication, purchase and rights management.

### Software Consultant (2 years)

During my time as a consultant I worked on site with a number of advertising
agencies in Sydney, working on more challenging technical projects that could
not be completed in house. These included augmented reality and 3D graphics,
Google Maps integration, a virtual character animation system and a project that
used face detection and image manipulation to render facial hair onto uploaded
user images.

My final consultant role was at Massive Interactive, where I was offered a full
time position based on my work.

### Creative Technologist (5 years)

At [Frost Design](https://frostcollective.com.au) I led a team of developers
building interactive interpretations of the high impact visual designs of Vince
Frost. The role challenged me to translate concepts from print to screen without
losing the powerful simplicity of the designers' vision. I also had the
opportunity to create experiences in a range of media, including 3D and stop
motion animation, and physical installations.

At [Ogilvy Interactive](https://www.ogilvy.com.au) I led a team of Flash
developers building games, micro-sites and other advertising for clients like
IBM, KFC, Coca-Cola and Uncle Tobys. I introduced basic engineering practices
like source control and a shared code library to the non-technical design team
and ran a monthly session for designers wanting to improve their coding skills.

At [Digital Eskimo](http://www.digitaleskimo.com.au) I built interactive art in
Flash and websites in HTML/JS/Flash and PHP. As the only developer in this small
business I was expected to jump between any job that came in.

At [Savv-e](https://savv-e.com.au) I built e-learning content in Flash and HTML.
I also introduced the team to a data/template driven approach from what had been
a very manual and bespoke development process.

## Trivia

- I've was born in Australia but have lived in Malaysia, Chile, France, and
  England. I speak passable Spanish and French.
- I have a Bachelor of Digital Media Degree from the University of New South
  Wales.
- My hobbies are largely the same as my non-hobbies, but when I'm not hacking or
  hanging out with my family I enjoy traveling, cooking and eating tasty food,
  and exercising to avoid the consequences of same.
- I'm almost certainly taller than you.
